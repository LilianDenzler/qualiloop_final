   abstract = {Antibody therapies with high efficiency and low toxicity are becoming one of the major approaches in antibody therapeutics. Based on high-throughput sequencing and increasing experimental structures of antibodies/antibody-antigen complexes, computational approaches can predict antibody/antigen structures, engineering the function of antibodies and design antibody-antigen complexes with improved properties. This review summarizes recent progress in the field of in silico design of antibodies, including antibody structure modeling, antibody-antigen complex prediction, antibody stability evaluation, and allosteric effects in antibodies and functions. We listed the cases in which these methods have helped experimental studies to improve the affinities and physicochemical properties of antibodies. We emphasized how the molecular dynamics unveiled the allosteric effects during antibody-antigen recognition and antibody-effector recognition.},

   abstract = {Current methods cannot tell us what the nature of the protein universe is concretely. They are based on different models of amino acid substitution and multiple sequence alignment which is an NP-hard problem and requires manual intervention. Protein structural analysis also gives a direction for mapping the protein universe. Unfortunately, now only a minuscule fraction of proteins' 3-dimensional structures are known. Furthermore, the phylogenetic tree representations are not unique for any existing tree construction methods. Here we develop a novel method to realize the nature of protein universe. We show the protein universe can be realized as a protein space in 60-dimensional Euclidean space using a distance based on a normalized distribution of amino acids. Every protein is in one-to-one correspondence with a point in protein space, where proteins with similar properties stay close together. Thus the distance between two points in protein space represents the biological distance of the corresponding two proteins. We also propose a natural graphical representation for inferring phylogenies. The representation is natural and unique based on the biological distances of proteins in protein space. This will solve the fundamental question of how proteins are distributed in the protein universe. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Both k-fold and leave-one-out cross validation are very popular for evaluating the performance of classification algorithms. Many data mining literatures introduce the operations for these two kinds of cross validation and the statistical methods that can be used to analyze the resulting accuracies of algorithms, while those contents are generally not all consistent. Analysts can therefore be confused in performing a cross validation procedure. In this paper, the independence assumptions in cross validation are introduced, and the circumstances that satisfy the assumptions are also addressed. The independence assumptions are then used to derive the sampling distributions of the point estimators for k-fold and leave-one-out cross validation. The cross validation procedure to have such sampling distributions is discussed to provide new insights in evaluating the performance of classification algorithms.},

Although the other five CDR loops adopt predictable canonical structures, H3 conformations have proven unclassifiable, other than an unusual C-terminal "kink" present in most antibodies. To determine why the majority of H3 loops are kinked and to learn whether non-antibody proteins have loop structures similar to those of H3, we searched a set of 15,679 high-quality non-antibody structures for regions geometrically similar to the residues immediately surrounding the loop. By incorporating the kink into our search, we identified 1,030 H3-like loops from 632 protein families. Some protein families, including PDZ domains, appear to use the identified region for recognition and binding. Our results suggest that the kink is conserved in the immunoglobulin heavy chain fold because it disrupts the β-strand pairing at the base of the loop. Thus, the kink is a critical driver of the observed structural diversity in CDR H3.},

Proteins 82: 1611-1623), and since then, we have presented new geometric parameters defining the kink conformation (Weitzner et al. 2015. Structure 23: 302-311). In this study, we use these parameters to develop a new biasing constraint. When applied to a benchmark set of high-quality CDR H3 loops, the average minimum root mean square deviation sampled is 0.93 Å, compared with 1.34 Å without the constraint. We then test the performance of the constrained de novo method for homology modeling and rigid-body docking and present the results for 1) the Antibody Modeling Assessment II targets, 2) the 2009 RosettaAntibody benchmark set, and 3) the high-quality set.},

   abstract = {Selection of appropriate climatic variables for prediction of electricity demand is critical as it affects the accuracy of the prediction. Different climatic variables may have different impacts on the electricity demand due to the varying geographical conditions. This paper uses multicollinearity and backward elimination processes to select the most appropriate variables and develop a multiple regression model for monthly forecasting of electricity demand. The former process is employed to reduce the collinearity between the explanatory variables by excluding the predictor which has highly linear relationship with the other independent variables in the dataset. In the next step, involving backward elimination regression analysis, the variables with coefficients that have a low level of significance are removed. A case study has been reported in this paper by acquiring the data from the state of New South Wales, Australia. The data analyses have revealed that the climatic variables such as temperature, humidity, and rainy days predominantly affect the electricity demand of the state of New South Wales. A regression model for monthly forecasting of the electricity demand is developed using the climatic variables that are dominant. The model has been trained and validated using the time series data. The monthly forecasted demands obtained using the proposed model are found to be closely matched with the actual electricity demands highlighting the fact that the prediction errors are well within the acceptable limits.},

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

Moreover, most methods available for sequence logo generation focus on displaying the position-specific enrichment of amino acids, discarding the equally valuable information related to amino acid depletion. Seq2logo aims at resolving these issues allowing the user to include sequence weighting to correct for data redundancy, pseudo counts to correct for low number of observations and different logotype representations each capturing different aspects related to amino acid enrichment and depletion. Besides allowing input in the format of peptides and MSA, Seq2Logo accepts input as Blast sequence profiles, providing easy access for non-expert end-users to characterize and identify functionally conserved/variable amino acids in any given protein of interest.

Here, we report the development and implementation of RosettaAntibody, a protocol for homology modeling of antibody variable regions. The protocol combines comparative modeling of canonical complementarity determining region (CDR) loop conformations and de novo loop modeling of CDR H3 conformation with simultaneous optimization of V L-V H rigid-body orientation and CDR backbone and side-chain conformations. The protocol was tested on a benchmark of 54 antibody crystal structures. The median root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the antigen binding pocket comprised of all the CDR residues was 1.5 Å with 80% of the targets having an rmsd lower than 2.0 Å. The median backbone heavy atom global rmsd of the CDR H3 loop prediction was 1.6, 1.9, 2.4, 3.1, and 6.0 Å for very short (4-6 residues), short (7-9), medium (10-11), long (12-14) and very long (17-22) loops, respectively. When the set of ten top-scoring antibody homology models are used in local ensemble docking to antigen, a moderate-to-high accuracy docking prediction was achieved in seven of fifteen targets. This success in computational docking with high-resolution homology models is encouraging, but challenges still remain in modeling antibody structures for sequences with long H3 loops. This first large-scale antibody-antigen docking study using homology models reveals the level of ''functional accuracy" of these structural models toward protein engineering applications. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: Immunoglobulin (IG) complementarity determining region (CDR) includes VH CDR1, VH CDR2, VH CDR3, VL CDR1, VL CDR2 and VL CDR3. Of these, VH CDR3 plays a dominant role in recognizing and binding antigens. Three major mechanisms are involved in the formation of the VH repertoire: germline gene rearrangement, junctional diversity and somatic hypermutation. Features of the generation mechanisms of VH repertoire in humans and mice share similarities while VH CDR3 amino acid (AA) composition differs. Previous studies have mainly focused on germline gene rearrangement and the composition and structure of the CDR3 AA in humans and mice. However the number of AA changes due to somatic hypermutation and analysis of the junctional mechanism have been ignored. Methods. Here we analyzed 9,340 human and 6,657 murine unique productive sequences of immunoglobulin (IG) variable heavy (VH) domains derived from IMGT/LIGM-DB database to understand how VH CDR3 AA compositions significantly differed between human and mouse. These sequences were identified and analyzed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST (), including gene usage, number of AA changes due to somatic hypermutation, AA length distribution of VH CDR3, AA composition, and junctional diversity. Results: Analyses of human and murine IG repertoires showed significant differences. A higher number of AA changes due to somatic hypermutation and more abundant N-region addition were found in human compared to mouse, which might be an important factor leading to differences in VH CDR3 amino acid composition. Conclusions: These findings are a benchmark for understanding VH repertoires and can be used to characterize the VH repertoire during immune responses. The study will allow standardized comparison for high throughput results obtained by IMGT/HighV-QUEST, the reference portal for NGS repertoire. © 2014 Shi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

The authors explain sequence logos, to show their usefulness for biological and linguistic research, and to encourage their use by others. A sequence logo is a graphic representation of the amount of information to be found in a set of DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. This method has advantages over the conventional method of creating a consensus. For example, a logo of DNA shows all the bases found in the binding site of a protein, indicates how much each base is conserved, and depicts the location of the conservation with respect to the major and minor grooves of the DNA.},

Constant improvements in performance within the Rosetta software suite for biomolecular modeling have given rise to a greater breadth of structure prediction, including docking and design application cases for antibody and antigen modeling. Here, we present an overview of current protocols for antibody and antigen modeling using Rosetta and exemplify those by detailed tutorials originally developed for a Rosetta workshop at Vanderbilt University. These tutorials cover antibody structure prediction, docking, and design and antigen design strategies, including the addition of glycans in Rosetta.

   abstract = {Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been categorized as evolving in overlapping phases. First, there is a viral phase that may well be asymptomatic or mild in the majority, perhaps 80% of patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in minimal disease in this initial phase are not well known. In the remaining 20% of cases, the disease may become severe and/or critical. In most patients of this latter group, there is a phase characterized by the hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. A third phase corresponds to a state of hypercoagulability. Finally, in the fourth stage organ injury and failure occur. Appearance of autoinflammatory/autoimmune phenomena in patients with COVID-19 calls attention for the development of new strategies for the management of life-threatening conditions in critically ill patients. Antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune cytopenia, Guillain-Barré syndrome and Kawasaki disease have each been reported in patients with COVID-19. Here we present a scoping review of the relevant immunological findings in COVID-19 as well as the current reports about autoinflammatory/autoimmune conditions associated with the disease. These observations have crucial therapeutic implications since immunomodulatory drugs are at present the most likely best candidates for COVID-19 therapy. Clinicians should be aware of these conditions in patients with COVID-19, and these observations should be considered in the current development of vaccines.},

   abstract = {We present in this paper a novel approach for training deterministic auto-encoders. We show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the classical reconstruction cost function , we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other regularized auto-encoders as well as denoising auto-encoders on a range of datasets. This penalty term corresponds to the Frobenius norm of the Jacobian matrix of the encoder activations with respect to the input. We show that this penalty term results in a localized space contraction which in turn yields robust features on the activation layer. Furthermore, we show how this penalty term is related to both regularized auto-encoders and denoising auto-encoders and how it can be seen as a link between deterministic and non-deterministic auto-encoders. We find empirically that this penalty helps to carve a representation that better captures the local directions of variation dictated by the data, corresponding to a lower-dimensional non-linear manifold, while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the manifold. Finally , we show that by using the learned features to initialize a MLP, we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets, surpassing other methods of pre-training.},

   abstract = {The H3 loop in the Complementarity Determining Region of antibodies plays a key role in their ability to bind the diverse space of potential antigens. It is also exceptionally difficult to model computationally causing a significant hurdle for in silico development of antibody biotherapeutics. In this article, we show that most H3s have unique structural characteristics which may explain why they are so challenging to model. We found that over 75% of H3 loops do not have a sub-Angstrom structural neighbor in the non-antibody world. Also, in a comparison with a nonredundant set of all protein fragments over 30% of H3 loops have a unique structure, with the average for all of other loops being less than 3%. We further observed that this structural difference can be seen at the level of four residue fragments where H3 loops present numerous novel conformations, and also at the level of individual residues with Tyrosine and Glycine often found in energetically unfavorable conformations.

@article{North2011,
   abstract = {Previous analyses of the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies have focused on a small number of "canonical" conformations for each loop. This is primarily the result of the work of Chothia and coworkers, most recently in 1997. Because of the widespread utility of antibodies, we have revisited the clustering of conformations of the six CDR loops with the much larger amount of structural information currently available. In this work, we were careful to use a high-quality data set by elfsiminating low-resolution structures and CDRs with high B-factors or high conformational energies. We used a distance function based on directional statistics and an effective clustering algorithm with affinity propagation. With this data set of over 300 nonredundant antibody structures, we were able to cover 28 CDR-length combinations (e.g., L1 length 11, or "L1-11" in our CDR-length nomenclature) for L1, L2, L3, H1, and H2. The Chothia analysis covered only 20 CDR-lengths. Only four of these had more than one conformational cluster, of which two could easily be distinguished by gene source (mouse/human; κ/λ) and one could easily be distinguished purely by the presence and the positions of Pro residues (L3-9). Thus, using the Chothia analysis does not require the complicated set of "structure-determining residues" that is often assumed. Of our 28 CDR-lengths, 15 have multiple conformational clusters, including 10 for which the Chothia analysis had only one canonical class. We have a total of 72 clusters for non-H3 CDRs; approximately 85% of the non-H3 sequences can be assigned to a conformational cluster based on gene source and/or sequence. We found that earlier predictions of "bulged" versus "nonbulged" conformations based on the presence or the absence of anchor residues Arg/Lys94 and Asp101 of H3 have not held up, since all four combinations lead to a majority of conformations that are bulged. Thus, the earlier analyses have been significantly enhanced by the increased data. We believe that the new classification will lead to improved methods for antibody structure prediction and design. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

At Stage 2 of the Second Antibody Modeling Assessment (AMA-II) held in 2013, the model structures of the CDR-H3 loops were submitted by the seven modelers and were critically assessed. After our participation in AMA-II, we rebuilt one of the long CDR-H3 loops with 13 residues (A52 antibody) by a more precise method, using enhanced conformational sampling with the explicit water model, as compared to our previous method employed at AMA-II. The current stable models obtained from the free energy landscape at 300 K include structures similar to the X-ray crystal structures. Those models were not built in our previous work at AMA-II. The current free energy landscape suggested that the CDR-H3 loop structures in the crystal are not stable in solution, but they are stabilized by the crystal packing effect.},

Results: We describe a method, based on the Random Forest automatic learning technique, to select structural templates for H3 loops among a dataset of candidates. These can be used to predict the structure of the loop with a higher accuracy than that achieved by any of the presently available methods. The method also has the advantage of being extremely fast and returning a reliable estimate of the model quality.},

   abstract = {We have analysed antigen-contacting residues and combining site shape in the antibody Fv and Fab crystal structures now available from the Protein Data Bank. Antigen-contacting propensities are presented for each antibody residue, allowing a new definition for the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) to be proposed based on observed antigen contacts. Contacts are more common at CDR residues which are located centrally within the combining site; some less central CDR residues are only contacted by large antigens. Non-contacting residues within the CDRs coincide with residues identified by Chothia and co-workers as important in defining 'canonical' conformations. An objective means of classifying protein surfaces by grass topography has been developed and applied to the antibody combining site surfaces. The surfaces have been clustered into four topographic classes: concave and moderately concave (mostly hapten binders), ridged (mostly peptide binders) and planar (mostly protein binders). We have determined the topographic classes for ten pairs of complexed and uncomplexed antibody-antigen crystal structures; four change topographic class on complexation. The results will be of use in antibody engineering, antigen docking and in clinical immunology. To demonstrate one application, we show how the data can be used to locate the antigen binding pocket on antibody structures.},

   abstract = {It has been more than three decades since the first monoclonal antibody was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in 1986, and during this time, antibody engineering has dramatically evolved. Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US\$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of \$150 billion by the end of 2019 and \$300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential. This review summarizes the latest market trends and outlines the preeminent antibody engineering technologies used in the development of therapeutic antibody drugs, such as humanization of monoclonal antibodies, phage display, the human antibody mouse, single B cell antibody technology, and affinity maturation. Finally, future applications and perspectives are also discussed.},

This paper addresses the fundamental issue of encoding amino acids in ways that the representation of such a protein sequence facilitates the decoding of its information content. We show that a feature-based representation in a three-dimensional (3D) space derived from amino acid substitution matrices provides an adequate representation that can be used for direct comparison of protein sequences based on geometry. We measure the performance of such a representation in the context of the protein structural fold prediction problem. We compare the results of classifying different sets of proteins belonging to distinct structural folds against classifications of the same proteins obtained from sequence alone or directly from structural information. We find that sequence alone performs poorly as a structure classifier. We show in contrast that the use of the three dimensional representation of the sequences significantly improves the classification accuracy. We conclude with a discussion of the current limitations of such a representation and with a description of potential improvements.},

We report here that, in the case of antibodies, diversity at one of these regions, CDR3 of the V(H) domain, is sufficient to permit otherwise identical IgM molecules to distinguish between a variety of hapten and protein antigens. Furthermore, we find that somatic mutation can allow such antibodies to achieve surprisingly high affinities. These results are consistent with a model in which the highly diverse CDR3 loops are the key determinant of specificity in antigen recognition in both T cell receptors (TCR) and antibodies, whereas the germline-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 sequences are much more cross-reactive.},

The steps of the pipeline include the selection of the appropriate framework for predicting the conserved regions of the molecule by homology; the target template alignment for this portion of the molecule; the selection of the main chain conformation of the hypervariable loops according to the canonical structure model, the prediction of the third loop of the heavy chain (H3) for which complete canonical structures are not available and the packing of the light and heavy chain if derived from different templates.

   abstract = {Computational modeling of antibody structures plays a critical role in therapeutic antibody design. Several antibody modeling pipelines exist, but no freely available methods currently model nanobodies, provide estimates of expected model accuracy, or highlight potential issues with the antibody's experimental development. Here, we describe our automated antibody modeling pipeline, ABodyBuilder, designed to overcome these issues. The algorithm itself follows the standard 4 steps of template selection, orientation prediction, complementarity-determining region (CDR) loop modeling, and side chain prediction. ABodyBuilder then annotates the ‘confidence’ of the model as a probability that a component of the antibody (e.g., CDRL3 loop) will be modeled within a root–mean square deviation threshold. It also flags structural motifs on the model that are known to cause issues during in vitro development. ABodyBuilder was tested on 4 separate datasets, including the 11 antibodies from the Antibody Modeling Assessment–II competition. ABodyBuilder builds models that are of similar quality to other methodologies, with sub–Angstrom predictions for the ‘canonical’ CDR loops. Its ability to model nanobodies, and rapidly generate models (∼30 seconds per model) widens its potential usage. ABodyBuilder can also help users in decision–making for the development of novel antibodies because it provides model confidence and potential sequence liabilities.

   abstract = {A program is described for drawing the van der Waal's surface of a protein molecule. An extension of the program permits the accessibility of atoms, or groups of atoms, to solvent or solute molecules of specified size to be quantitatively assessed. As defined in this study, the accessibility is proportional to surface area. The accessibility of all atoms in the twenty common amino acids in model tripeptides of the type Ala-X-Ala are given for defined conformation. The accessibilities are also given for all atoms in ribonuclease-S, lysozyme and myogoblin. Internal cavities are defined and discussed. Various summaries of these data are provided. Forty to fifty per cent of the surface area of each protein is occupied by non-polar atoms. The actual numerical results are sensitive to the values chosen for the van der Waal's radii of the various groups. Since there is uncertainty over the correct values for these radii, the derived numbers should only be used as a qualitative guide at this stage. The average change in accessibility for the atoms of all three proteins in going from a hypothetical extended chain to the folded conformation of the native protein is about a factor of 3. This number applies to both polar (nitrogen and oxygen) and non-polar (carbon and sulfur) atoms considered separately. The larger non-polar amino acids tend to be more "buried" in the native form of all three proteins. However, for all classes and for residues within a given class the accessibility changes on folding tend to be highly variable. © 1971.},

Current state-of-the-art methods can yield models with high variance, rendering them unsuitable for a number of practical applications including QSAR. In this paper we describe and evaluate best practices which improve reliability and increase confidence in selected models. A key operational component of the proposed methods is cloud computing which enables routine use of previously infeasible approaches. Methods. We describe in detail an algorithm for repeated grid-search V-fold cross-validation for parameter tuning in classification and regression, and we define a repeated nested cross-validation algorithm for model assessment. As regards variable selection and parameter tuning we define two algorithms (repeated grid-search cross-validation and double cross-validation), and provide arguments for using the repeated grid-search in the general case. Results: We show results of our algorithms on seven QSAR datasets. The variation of the prediction performance, which is the result of choosing different splits of the dataset in V-fold cross-validation, needs to be taken into account when selecting and assessing classification and regression models. Conclusions: We demonstrate the importance of repeating cross-validation when selecting an optimal model, as well as the importance of repeating nested cross-validation when assessing a prediction error. © 2014 Krstajic et al.; licensee Chemistry Central Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: There is an ever-expanding range of technologies that generate very large numbers of biomarkers for research and clinical applications. Choosing the most informative biomarkers from a high-dimensional data set, combined with identifying the most reliable and accurate classification algorithms to use with that biomarker set, can be a daunting task. Existing surveys of feature selection and classification algorithms typically focus on a single data type, such as gene expression microarrays, and rarely explore the model's performance across multiple biological data types. Results: This paper presents the results of a large scale empirical study whereby a large number of popular feature selection and classification algorithms are used to identify the tissue of origin for the NCI-60 cancer cell lines. A computational pipeline was implemented to maximize predictive accuracy of all models at all parameters on five different data types available for the NCI-60 cell lines. A validation experiment was conducted using external data in order to demonstrate robustness. Conclusions: As expected, the data type and number of biomarkers have a significant effect on the performance of the predictive models. Although no model or data type uniformly outperforms the others across the entire range of tested numbers of markers, several clear trends are visible. At low numbers of biomarkers gene and protein expression data types are able to differentiate between cancer cell lines significantly better than the other three data types, namely SNP, array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH), and microRNA data. Interestingly, as the number of selected biomarkers increases best performing classifiers based on SNP data match or slightly outperform those based on gene and protein expression, while those based on aCGH and microRNA data continue to perform the worst. It is observed that one class of feature selection and classifier are consistently top performers across data types and number of markers, suggesting that well performing feature-selection/classifier pairings are likely to be robust in biological classification problems regardless of the data type used in the analysis.},

We provide a statistical analysis showing that if, for example, the expected character error rate is around 1 percent, then, with a test set of at least 10,000 statistically independent handwritten characters (which could be obtained by taking 100 characters from each of 100 different writers), we guarantee, with 95 percent confidence, that: (1) The expected value of the character error rate is not worse than 1.25 E, where E is the empirical character error rate of the best recognizer, calculated on the test set; and (2) a difference of 0.3 E between the error rates of two recognizers is significant. We developed this framework with character recognition applications in mind, but it applies as well to speech recognition and to other pattern recognition problems.},

   abstract = {Predicted assignments of biological sequences are often evaluated by Matthews correlation coefficient. However, Matthews correlation coefficient applies only to cases where the assignments belong to two categories, and cases with more than two categories are often artificially forced into two categories by considering what belongs and what does not belong to one of the categories, leading to the loss of information. Here, an extended correlation coefficient that applies to K-categories is proposed, and this measure is shown to be highly applicable for evaluating prediction of RNA secondary structure in cases where some predicted pairs go into the category "unknown" due to lack of reliability in predicted pairs or unpaired residues. Hence, predicting base pairs of RNA secondary structure can be a three-category problem. The measure is further shown to be well in agreement with existing performance measures used for ranking protein secondary structure predictions.

   abstract = {Precision-Recall analysis abounds in applications of binary classification where true negatives do not add value and hence should not affect assessment of the classifier's performance. Perhaps inspired by the many advantages of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under such curves for accuracy-based performance assessment, many researchers have taken to report Precision-Recall (PR) curves and associated areas as performance metric. We demonstrate in this paper that this practice is fraught with difficulties, mainly because of incoherent scale assumptions-e.g., the area under a PR curve takes the arithmetic mean of precision values whereas the F β score applies the harmonic mean. We show how to fix this by plotting PR curves in a different coordinate system, and demonstrate that the new Precision-Recall-Gain curves inherit all key advantages of ROC curves. In particular, the area under Precision-Recall-Gain curves conveys an expected F 1 score on a harmonic scale, and the convex hull of a Precision-Recall-Gain curve allows us to calibrate the classifier's scores so as to determine, for each operating point on the convex hull, the interval of β values for which the point optimises F β. We demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional PR curves can easily favour models with lower expected F 1 score than others, and so the use of Precision-Recall-Gain curves will result in better model selection.},

   abstract = {Structural restrictions are present even in the most sequence diverse portions of antibodies, the complementary determining region (CDR) loops. Previous studies identified robust rules that define canonical structures for five of the six CDR loops, however the heavy chain CDR 3 (HCDR3) defies standard classification attempts. The HCDR3 loop can be subdivided into two domains referred to as the "torso" and the "head" domains and two major families of canonical torso structures have been identified; the more prevalent "bulged" and less frequent "non-bulged" torsos. In the present study, we found that Rosetta loop modeling of 28 benchmark bulged HCDR3 loops is improved with knowledge-based structural restraints developed from available antibody crystal structures in the PDB. These restraints restrict the sampling space Rosetta searches in the torso domain, limiting the and Ψ angles of these residues to conformations that have been experimentally observed. The application of these restraints in Rosetta result in more native-like structure sampling and improved score-based differentiation of native-like HCDR3 models, significantly improving our ability to model antibody HCDR3 loops.Copyright:},

   abstract = {Background: Supervised learning methods need annotated data in order to generate efficient models. Annotated data, however, is a relatively scarce resource and can be expensive to obtain. For both passive and active learning methods, there is a need to estimate the size of the annotated sample required to reach a performance target. Methods. We designed and implemented a method that fits an inverse power law model to points of a given learning curve created using a small annotated training set. Fitting is carried out using nonlinear weighted least squares optimization. The fitted model is then used to predict the classifier's performance and confidence interval for larger sample sizes. For evaluation, the nonlinear weighted curve fitting method was applied to a set of learning curves generated using clinical text and waveform classification tasks with active and passive sampling methods, and predictions were validated using standard goodness of fit measures. As control we used an un-weighted fitting method. Results: A total of 568 models were fitted and the model predictions were compared with the observed performances. Depending on the data set and sampling method, it took between 80 to 560 annotated samples to achieve mean average and root mean squared error below 0.01. Results also show that our weighted fitting method outperformed the baseline un-weighted method (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This paper describes a simple and effective sample size prediction algorithm that conducts weighted fitting of learning curves. The algorithm outperformed an un-weighted algorithm described in previous literature. It can help researchers determine annotation sample size for supervised machine learning. © 2012 Figueroa et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

In the case of antibodies, there are a number of special considerations: (i) identifying antibodies in the PDB is not trivial, (ii) they may be crystallized with or without antigen, (iii) for analysis purposes, one is normally only interested in the Fv region of the antibody, (iv) structural analysis of epitopes, in particular, requires individual antibody-antigen complexes from a PDB file which may contain multiple copies of the same, or different, antibodies and (v) standard numbering schemes should be applied. Consequently, there is a need for a specialist resource containing pre-numbered non-redundant antibody Fv structures with their cognate antigens. We have created an automatically updated resource, AbDb, which collects the Fv regions from antibody structures using information from our SACS database which summarizes antibody structures from the PDB. PDB files containing multiple structures are split and numbered and each antibody structure is associated with its antigen where available. Antibody structures with only light or heavy chains have also been processed and sequences of antibodies are compared to identify multiple structures of the same antibody. The data may be queried on the basis of PDB code, or the name or species of the antibody or antigen, and the complete datasets may be downloaded.},

@article{Elabd2020,
   abstract = {Background: The number of applications of deep learning algorithms in bioinformatics is increasing as they usually achieve superior performance over classical approaches, especially, when bigger training datasets are available. In deep learning applications, discrete data, e.g. words or n-grams in language, or amino acids or nucleotides in bioinformatics, are generally represented as a continuous vector through an embedding matrix. Recently, learning this embedding matrix directly from the data as part of the continuous iteration of the model to optimize the target prediction - a process called 'end-to-end learning' - has led to state-of-the-art results in many fields. Although usage of embeddings is well described in the bioinformatics literature, the potential of end-to-end learning for single amino acids, as compared to more classical manually-curated encoding strategies, has not been systematically addressed. To this end, we compared classical encoding matrices, namely one-hot, VHSE8 and BLOSUM62, to end-to-end learning of amino acid embeddings for two different prediction tasks using three widely used architectures, namely recurrent neural networks (RNN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and the hybrid CNN-RNN. Results: By using different deep learning architectures, we show that end-to-end learning is on par with classical encodings for embeddings of the same dimension even when limited training data is available, and might allow for a reduction in the embedding dimension without performance loss, which is critical when deploying the models to devices with limited computational capacities. We found that the embedding dimension is a major factor in controlling the model performance. Surprisingly, we observed that deep learning models are capable of learning from random vectors of appropriate dimension. Conclusion: Our study shows that end-to-end learning is a flexible and powerful method for amino acid encoding. Further, due to the flexibility of deep learning systems, amino acid encoding schemes should be benchmarked against random vectors of the same dimension to disentangle the information content provided by the encoding scheme from the distinguishability effect provided by the scheme.},

@article{Eisenberg1982,
   abstract = {The structure of a protein can be analysed in terms of what may be called the "hydrophobic moments" of (1) the entire molecule and (2) of the segments of secondary structure that make up the polypeptide chain. The zeroth moment is defined as the sum of the hydrophobicities of the amino-acid residues of the structure under consideration; it is the analogue of the net charge of a cluster of point charges. The first moment, or hydrophobic dipole moment, is the analogue of the electric dipole moment of a cluster of charges. Just as the electric dipole moment measures the asymmetry of the charge distribution, the hydrophobic dipole moment measures the amphiphilicity (asymmetry of hydrophobicity) of the structure. A large hydrophobic dipole moment indicates that a structure is predominantly hydrophobic on one side and predominantly hydrophilic on the other. A quadrupole hydrophobic moment may be similarly defined. It indicates whether a protein is more hydrophobic in its interior (as for a globular protein in aqueous solution) or at its surface (as for a membrane protein). The hydrophobic dipole moment is useful in two separate applications. The first, which we have discussed elsewhere [D. Eisenberg, R. M. Weiss and T. C. Terwilliger, Nature (London), 1982, 299, 371] relates the function and secondary structure of a region of protein structure to its amino-acid sequence. For example, sequences that form surface-seeking helices have large hydrophobic dipole moments. The second application is in the analysis of interactions of a segment or domain of a protein with neighbouring regions in the protein and with other parts of the environment. In this paper we examine the hydrophobic dipole moments in the known structures of nine globular proteins and find that the moments of neighbouring segments tend to point towards each other. This suggests that the hydrophobic dipole can serve as a simple and pictorial summary of some of the forces at work in the folding of proteins. We have also found that the interactions of some macromolecules with an apolar-polar interface can be conveniently described in terms of the hydrophobic moments of the molecule and a "hydrophobic field" which reflects the hydrophobicity of the environment.},

Repertoire sequencing studies of bovine antibody heavy chain variable sequences revealed that bovine antibodies can contain heavy chain complementarity determining region 3 (CDRH3) loops with 60 or more amino acids, with complex structures stabilized by multiple disulfide bonds. It is clear that bovine antibodies can achieve long, peculiarly structured CDR3s, but the range of diversity and complexity of those structures is poorly understood. We determined the atomic resolution structure of seven ultralong bovine CDRH3 loops.

   abstract = {Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a difficult and important problem in biology. Since experimental methods for predicting PPIs are both expensive and time-consuming, many computational methods have been developed to predict PPIs and interaction networks, which can be used to complement experimental approaches. However, these methods have limitations to overcome. They need a large number of homology proteins or literature to be applied in their method. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix-based protein sequence representation approach to predict PPIs, using an ensemble learning method for classification. We construct the matrix of Amino Acid Contact (AAC), based on the statistical analysis of residue-pairing frequencies in a database of 6323 protein-protein complexes. We first represent the protein sequence as a Substitution Matrix Representation (SMR) matrix. Then, the feature vector is extracted by applying algorithms of Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the SMR matrix. Finally, we feed the feature vector into a Random Forest (RF) for judging interaction pairs and non-interaction pairs. Our method is applied to several PPI datasets to evaluate its performance. On the S. cerevisiae dataset, our method achieves 94.83% accuracy and 92.40% sensitivity. Compared with existing methods, and the accuracy of our method is increased by 0.11 percentage points. On the H. pylori dataset, our method achieves 89.06% accuracy and 88.15% sensitivity, the accuracy of our method is increased by 0.76%. On the Human PPI dataset, our method achieves 97.60% accuracy and 96.37% sensitivity, and the accuracy of our method is increased by 1.30%. In addition, we test our method on a very important PPI network, and it achieves 92.71% accuracy. In the Wnt-related network, the accuracy of our method is increased by 16.67%.

Numerous promising therapeutic and vaccine research efforts to mitigate the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 pandemic are underway, yet an efficacious countermeasure is still not available. To support these global research efforts, we have used a novel computational pipeline combining machine learning, bioinformatics, and supercomputing to predict antibody structures capable of targeting the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). In 22 days, using just the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and previously published neutralizing antibody structures for SARS-CoV-1, we generated 20 initial antibody sequences predicted to target the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. As a first step in this process, we predicted (and publicly released) structures of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using homology-based structural modeling. The predicted structures proved to be accurate within the targeted RBD region when compared to experimentally derived structures published weeks later. Next we used our in silico design platform to iteratively propose mutations to SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies (known not to bind SARS-Cov-2) to enable and optimize binding within the RBD of SARS-CoV-2. Starting from a calculated baseline free energy of-48.1 kcal/mol (± 8.3), our 20 selected first round antibody structures are predicted to have improved interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with free energies as low as-82.0 kcal/mole. The baseline SARS-CoV-1 antibody in complex with the SARS-CoV-1 RBD has a calculated interaction energy of-52.2 kcal/mole and neutralizes the virus by preventing it from binding and entering the human ACE2 receptor. These results suggest that our predicted antibody mutants may bind the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and potentially neutralize the virus. Additionally, our selected antibody mutants score well according to multiple antibody developability metrics. These antibody designs are being expressed and experimentally tested for binding to COVID-19 viral proteins, which will provide invaluable feedback to further improve the machine learning-driven designs. This technical report is a high-level description of that effort; the Supplementary Materials includes the homology-based structural models we developed and 178,856 in silico free energy calculations for 89,263 mutant antibodies derived from known SARS-CoV-1 neutralizing antibodies.},

   abstract = {We show that Cohen’s Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), both extended and contrasted measures of performance in multi-class classification, are correlated in most situations, albeit can differ in others. Indeed, although in the symmetric case both match, we consider different unbalanced situations in which Kappa exhibits an undesired behaviour, i.e. a worse classifier gets higher Kappa score, differing qualitatively from that of MCC. The debate about the incoherence in the behaviour of Kappa revolves around the convenience, or not, of using a relative metric, which makes the interpretation of its values difficult. We extend these concerns by showing that its pitfalls can go even further. Through experimentation, we present a novel approach to this topic. We carry on a comprehensive study that identifies an scenario in which the contradictory behaviour among MCC and Kappa emerges. Specifically, we find out that when there is a decrease to zero of the entropy of the elements out of the diagonal of the confusion matrix associated to a classifier, the discrepancy between Kappa and MCC rise, pointing to an anomalous performance of the former. We believe that this finding disables Kappa to be used in general as a performance measure to compare classifiers.},

This method combines analysis of individual discrete voids with analysis of packing quality. While these are different aspects of the same effect, they have traditionally been analysed using different approaches. The method has been applied to the calculation of total void volume and maximum void size in a non-redundant set of protein domains and has been used to examine correlations between thermal stability and void size. The tumour-suppressor protein p53 has then been compared with the non-redundant data set to determine whether its low thermal stability results from poor packing. We found that p53 has average packing, but the detrimental effects of some previously unexplained mutations to p53 observed in cancer can be explained by the creation of unusually large voids. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a method where four distances are calculated between any two side chains to provide an exact spatial definition of their bonds. The data were binned into a four-dimensional grid and compared to a random model, from which the preference for specific four-distances was calculated. A clear relation between the quality of the experimental data and the tightness of the distance distribution was observed, with crystal structure data providing far tighter distance distributions than NMR data. Since the four-distance data have higher information content than classical bond descriptions, we were able to identify many unique inter-residue features not found previously in proteins. For example, we found that the side chains of Arg, Glu, Val and Leu are not symmetrical in respect to the interactions of their head groups. The described method may be developed into a function, which computationally models accurately protein structures. © 2009 Cohen et al.},

   abstract = {Loops are the most variable regions of protein structure and are, in general, the least accurately predicted. Their prediction has been approached in two ways, ab initio and database search. In recent years, it has been thought that ab initio methods are more powerful. In light of the continued rapid expansion in the number of known protein structures, we have re-evaluated FREAD, a database search method and demonstrate that the power of database search methods may have been underestimated. We found that sequence similarity as quantified by environment specific substitution scores can be used to significantly improve prediction. In fact, FREAD performs appreciably better for an identifiable subset of loops (two thirds of shorter loops and half of the longer loops tested) than the ab initio methods of MODELLER, PLOP, and RAPPER. Within this subset, FREAD's predictive ability is length independent, in general, producing results within 2A RMSD, compared to an average of over 10Å for loop length 20 for any of the other tested methods. We also benchmarked the prediction protocols on a set of 212 loops from the model structures in CASP 7 and 8. An extended version of FREAD is able to make predictions for 127 of these, it gives the best prediction of the methods tested in 61 of these cases. In examining FREAD's ability to predict in the model environment, we found that whole structure quality did not affect the quality of loop predictions. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {Background: To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. Results: The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. Conclusions: In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

The scientific community has not agreed on a general-purpose statistical indicator for evaluating two-class confusion matrices (having true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives) yet, even if advantages of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) over accuracy and F1 score have already been shown. In this manuscript, we reaffirm that MCC is a robust metric that summarizes the classifier performance in a single value, if positive and negative cases are of equal importance. We compare MCC to other metrics which value positive and negative cases equally: balanced accuracy (BA), bookmaker informedness (BM), and markedness (MK). We explain the mathematical relationships between MCC and these indicators, then show some use cases and a bioinformatics scenario where these metrics disagree and where MCC generates a more informative response. Additionally, we describe three exceptions where BM can be more appropriate: analyzing classifications where dataset prevalence is unrepresentative, comparing classifiers on different datasets, and assessing the random guessing level of a classifier. Except in these cases, we believe that MCC is the most informative among the single metrics discussed, and suggest it as standard measure for scientists of all fields. A Matthews correlation coefficient close to +1, in fact, means having high values for all the other confusion matrix metrics. The same cannot be said for balanced accuracy, markedness, bookmaker informedness, accuracy and F1 score.},

The validation set adjusts the weights of the hypotheses. The hypotheses generated by all subsets are then aggregated with a weighted plurality vote for final classification.

Accurate knowledge of their structure is central to understanding their antigen-binding function. The key area for antigen binding and the main area of structural variation in antibodies are concentrated in the six complementarity determining regions (CDRs), with the most important for binding and most variable being the CDR-H3 loop. The sequence and structural variability of CDR-H3 make it particularly challenging to model. Recently deep learning methods have offered a step change in our ability to predict protein structures. Results: In this work, we present ABlooper, an end-to-end equivariant deep learning-based CDR loop structure prediction tool. ABlooper rapidly predicts the structure of CDR loops with high accuracy and provides a confidence estimate for each of its predictions. On the models of the Rosetta Antibody Benchmark, ABlooper makes predictions with an average CDR-H3 RMSD of 2.49 Å, which drops to 2.05 Å when considering only its 75% most confident predictions.},

Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both β-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140-142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations. © 1975.},

These errors may involve either the description or the meaning of data (namely, syntactic or semantic errors). We focus our analysis on the detection of semantic errors, in order to verify the accuracy of the stored information. In particular, we address the issue of data constraints and functional dependencies among attributes in a given relational database. Constraints and dependencies show semantics among attributes in a database schema and their knowledge may be exploited to improve data quality and integration in database design, and to perform query optimization and dimensional reduction.We propose a method to discover data constraints and functional dependencies by means of association rule mining. Association rules are extracted among attribute values and allow us to find causality relationships among them. Then, by analyzing the support and confidence of each rule, (probabilistic) data constraints and functional dependencies may be detected. With our method we can both show the presence of erroneous data and highlight novel semantic information. Moreover, our method is database-independent because it infers rules from data.In this paper, we report the application of our techniques to the SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) and CATH Protein Structure Classification databases.},

   abstract = {A blinded study to assess the state of the art in three-dimensional structure modeling of the variable region (Fv) of antibodies was conducted. Nine unpublished high-resolution x-ray Fab crystal structures covering a wide range of antigen-binding site conformations were used as benchmark to compare Fv models generated by four structure prediction methodologies. The methodologies included two homology modeling strategies independently developed by CCG (Chemical Computer Group) and Accerlys Inc, and two fully automated antibody modeling servers: PIGS (Prediction of ImmunoGlobulin Structure), based on the canonical structure model, and Rosetta Antibody Modeling, based on homology modeling and Rosetta structure prediction methodology. The benchmark structure sequences were submitted to Accelrys and CCG and a set of models for each of the nine antibody structures were generated. PIGS and Rosetta models were obtained using the default parameters of the servers. In most cases, we found good agreement between the models and x-ray structures. The average rmsd (root mean square deviation) values calculated over the backbone atoms between the models and structures were fairly consistent, around 1.2 Å. Average rmsd values of the framework and hypervariable loops with canonical structures (L1, L2, L3, H1, and H2) were close to 1.0 Å. H3 prediction yielded rmsd values around 3.0 Å for most of the models. Quality assessment of the models and the relative strengths and weaknesses of the methods are discussed. We hope this initiative will serve as a model of scientific partnership and look forward to future antibody modeling assessments. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

   abstract = {The spillover of emerging viruses from their animal reservoirs into human populations continuously threatens public health. Multiple coronaviruses have emerged to cause lethal viral pneumonias in humans: they include MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, emerged in late 2019 and has since caused a pandemic of unprecedented scale in recent history. Therapeutic and prophylactic interventions against COVID-19 are urgently needed. The coronavirus spike (S) protein mediates cell surface receptor binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. The S protein is a target for anti viral antibodies produced during natural infection and comprises two functional subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunits of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 contain a receptor-binding domain that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the surface of host cells. S2 contains a transmembrane anchor and mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes after particles are internalized into acidified endosomes, although fusion at the cell surface can also occur in certain scenarios. Neutralizing antibodies could block viral entry by preventing the S protein from binding to host cell receptors (for example, ACE2) or by preventing the con-formational changes the S protein undergoes to mediate membrane fusion (Fig. 1a). Neutralizing antibodies could also mimic receptor binding and prematurely trigger fusogenic conformational changes in the S protein before it engages ACE2. Convalescent plasma therapy Passive immunization with convalescent plasma involves transfusing the acellular portion of blood from individuals who have recovered from an infection to persons who are infected or at risk of infection. Plasma donors are presumed to have developed an effective antibody response to the offending pathogen. The conferred immunity is short term. Some of the most convincing data supporting the use of convalescent plasma in acute viral infection are from studies on Argentine haemorrhagic fever, an illness caused by Junin virus that carries a case fatality rate of 15-30%. In a prospective study involving more than 80 cases of Argentine haemorrhagic fever, individuals received convalescent plasma predetermined , in vitro, to have a range of neutralizing antibody titres. Transfusion of convalescent plasma with a high neutralizing antibody titre (dose adjusted per recipient body weight) was required for therapeutic effectiveness. No deaths were observed in the highest titre treatment group, which included 34 individuals 1. A retrospective analysis defined the importance of providing the plasma within 8 days of the onset of illness. Convalescent plasma is now used routinely to treat Argentine haemorrhagic fever. Transfusion of convalescent plasma did not show any benefit in Ebola virus disease during a recent outbreak 2. However, the neutralizing titre of the infused convalescent plasma was later found to be low. A retrospective study of patients with SARS receiving therapy with ster-oids and the antiviral ribavirin showed that those also receiving convalescent plasma were discharged earlier from the hospital 3. The neutralizing antibody titre of the infused plasma, however, was not standardized, and the comparator group remained on steroids, which could have confounded the outcome 3. In a recent prospective, non-controlled study involving individuals with severe COVID-19, Duan et al. 4 transfused plasma with high-titre neutralizing activity from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19. Post-transfusion, recipients had a rapid increase in serum neutralizing antibody titres, had no detectable SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in their blood at the time of sampling and improved clinically. Another study showed that convalescent plasma given with a median time of more than 20 days after viral shedding was first detected had an apparent effect on viral clearance but no effect on mortality 5 , suggesting that the timing of transfusion fell out of the therapeutic window. The ongoing pandemic is an opportunity to perform randomized and controlled studies to support the use of convalescent plasma in the treatment of COVID-19. Ideally, such studies would include a group receiving convalescent plasma with pre-defined high-titre For over a century, transfusion of convalescent plasma from recovered individuals has been tried as a therapeutic approach when a novel pathogen emerges. As the world awaits SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to be tested and safely deployed, the rapidity with which antiviral monoclonal antibodies can be isolated and engineered offers an attractive alternative option for passive immunization.},

   abstract = {The packing of VH and VL domains in antibodies can vary, influencing the topography of the antigen-combining site. However, until recently, this has largely been ignored in modelling antibody structure. We present an analysis of the degree of variability observed in known structures together with a machine-learning approach to predict the packing angle. A neural network was trained on sets of interface residues and a genetic algorithm designed to perform 'feature selection' to define which sets of interface residues could be used most successfully to perform the prediction. While this training procedure was very computationally intensive, prediction is performed in a matter of seconds. Thus, not only do we provide a rapid method for predicting the packing angle, but also we define a set of residues that may be important in antibody humanization in order to obtain the correct binding site topography.

   abstract = {Genetically engineered mouse antibodies are now commonly in clinical use. However, their development is limited because the human immune system tends to regard them as foreign and this triggers an immune response. The solution is to make engineered antibodies appear more human. Here, we propose a method to assess the ``degree of humanness'' of antibody sequences providing a tool that may contribute to predictions of antigenicity. We analyzed sequences of antibodies belonging to various chains/classes in human and mouse. Our analysis of metrics based on percentage sequence identity between antibody sequences shows distinct differences between human and mouse sequences. Based on mean sequence identity and standard deviation, we calculated Z-scores for data sets of antibody sequences extracted from the Kabat database. We applied the analysis to a set of humanized and chimeric antibodies and to human germline sequences. We conclude that this approach may aid in the selection of more suitable mouse variable domains for antibody engineering to render them more human but in general, we find that typicality of a sequence compared with the expressed human repertoire is not well correlated with antigenicity. We have provided a Web server allowing humanness to be assigned for a sequence†.1http://www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/shab/. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
